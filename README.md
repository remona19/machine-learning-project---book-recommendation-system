In an era of information abundance, where readers are inundated with countless book options, the need for personalized recommendations has never been more critical. Collaborative filtering, a prominent technique in recommendation systems, offers a powerful solution to this challenge. Collaborative filtering operates on the principle of collective intelligence, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to make personalized recommendations. Unlike content-based approaches that analyse book characteristics, collaborative filtering focuses on user behaviour, specifically user-item interactions. It identifies patterns and similarities among users based on their past interactions with books to predict preferences and generate recommendations. In the digital age where access to vast libraries of books is at our fingertips, personalized book recommendation systems have become essential tools for assisting readers in discovering content aligned with their interests. This report provides an overview of a book recommendation system implemented using collaborative filtering, highlighting its methodology, performance evaluation, and potential applications.
